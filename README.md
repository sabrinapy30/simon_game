Once the computer begins a round by activating the sequence of buttons, the player needs to end the round by repeating the pattern of button activations in the right order. If a step is missed along the way, the game ends.

Example:

1) The game shows the first colour in the sequence (blue), the user has to click on the blue button.
2) Next, the game shows the next colour (red), the user has to remember the sequence is blue, red and so on and so forth.
3) If the user messes up the sequence, then the game ends.
